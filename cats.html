        <h2>Cat Care</h2>
        <p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most
            popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and
            diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the
            well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.</p>

            <h3>Top Pet Care Tips for Cats</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0 to 4-Weeks:</strong> Kitten is nursing. Monitor kitten growth carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>Age 4-Weeks to 1-Year:</strong> Kitten begins eating a combination of soft and hard foods.
                    Consult with your vet for recommendations for your kitten's dietary needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Age 1-Year to 7-Years:</strong> Cat now needs less food as growth stage is slowing or
                    ending. Prevent your cat from overeating by providing x2 meals a day.</li>
                <li><strong>Age 7-Years and More:</strong> Cats need less fats and calories as they age (just like
                    humans). Look for cat food that includes high-quality protein.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Age 0 to 4-Weeks</h3>
            <p>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing)
                directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its growth rate
                is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to
                feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube.</p>
            <p>Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
                <li>Gastrointestinal disease</li>
                <li>Environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Age 4-Weeks to 1-Year</h3>
            <p>Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after
                birth. According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips"
                    class="customLink" target="_blank">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry
                kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating
                hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for
                kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Age 1-Year to 7-Years</h3>
            <p>This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their level
                of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to leave
                food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than
                snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline
                ailments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h3>Age 7-Years and More</h3>
            <p>Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at
                this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
                packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and
                <strong>not</strong> just a category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or
                combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
